cat << EOF
usage: $0 [OPTIONS] [--] COMMAND

Takes the output of a COMMAND and reports it to Sensu.
By default raises 2 (Critical) on any non-0 exit code from the COMMAND

OPTIONS:
   -h      Show help
   -n      Specify the name of the check. Defaults to the name of the command you run with args,
           with non-compliant characters replaced with underscores.
   -l      Send the output of the COMMAND to logger as well as Sensu with a provided tag.
   -d      Dry run, send the output what would be sent to Sensu to stderr.
   -H      String of an array of handlers. Defaults to empty. (use default handlers)
   -j      Specify custom json to cover a need that I can't think of. (see examples)
   -c      Count of the numer of lines to output ot sensu. Default: 3
   -N      Nagios Compliant. Use when the COMMAND returns 0,1,2,3 appropriately.

Examples:

    $0 /bin/false
    (reports the output to sensu sliently, with a name of /bin/false)

    $0 -l dailycron -n "Daily Apt Get Cron" /usr/bin/apt-get update
    (Get a sensu alert when your daily apt-get cron job fails, and get logs to syslog)

    $0 -H '["email", "pagerduty"]' -- /usr/bin/my_critical_command
    (Be explicity about handlers to use. Optional -- to separate the command)

    $0 -n "Special Check" -j '"playbook": "http://wiki/special_check", "metric: false",' -- /usr/bin/special_check
    (For when you need extra json in the output. NOTE: INCLUDE A TRAILING COMMA)
